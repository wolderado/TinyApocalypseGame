A tiny FPS zombie apocalypse game in 200kb. The game is made for 4MBJam. With UPX compressor, exe size could be reduced to 176KB.

I'm newbie in C so don't judge too harshly :D I learned the language as I was making this project. Making games without OOP is kinda hard. So there are lots of repeated stuff and badly written codes. But it works. Hurray I guess :D
